# Project Aegis — Swarm Robotics Starter

**Status:** Early-stage prototype. Code and hardware are under active development and subject to change.

---

## Objective

Project Aegis is a swarm robotics initiative focused on demonstrating distributed autonomy, cooperative sensing, and resilient coordination using low-cost hardware.  
The immediate goal is to develop small ground robots capable of patrolling, mapping, and responding to their environment as a team.

Key elements of the current effort:
- Ground-based Aegis bots powered by ESP32 microcontrollers
- Motor control via TB6612FNG drivers
- Sensor suite: ultrasonic rangefinders, PIR detectors, and IMUs
- Servo-mounted ultrasonic scanning for environmental mapping
- Communication through ESP-NOW or Wi-Fi mesh networking
- Data visualization through a ground-station dashboard

---


## Future Development

Project Aegis is designed as a modular ecosystem. Planned extensions include:

- **Argus**: an AI-powered turret platform (Raspberry Pi + camera) for intruder detection and real-time tracking  
- **Aegis–Argus Integration**: a combined system where Argus provides vision-based detection while Aegis bots swarm to investigate or intercept  
- Expansion into lightweight aerial platforms to complement the ground units (**Aether**)

## Next Steps

- Implement multi-robot coordination strategies (mesh networking, role assignment)
- Develop a real-time dashboard for monitoring swarm health and mission progress
- Begin integration testing of the Aegis–Argus hybrid workflow
